BUCKy 1.2 README
For higher versions, please refer to the user's manual.

INSTALLATION
Pick a directory where you want the BUCKy code to be.
I will call this directory $BUCKY_HOME in this documentation.
To open the compressed tar file with the BUCKy source code and example data,
do these commands.

  cd $BUCKY_HOME
  tar zxf bucky-1.2.tgz

This creates a directory named BUCKy-1.2 with subdirectories BUCKy-1.2/data and BUCKy-1.2/src .

COMPILATION
If you have gcc installed, compile the software with these commands.

  cd $BUCKY_HOME/BUCKy-1.2/src
  make

This will compile programs mbsum and bucky.
I suggest putting copies in ~/bin if this is in your path.

If you do not have gcc installed, you need to find the installer.
On a Macintosh, it may be in Applications/Installers/Developer Tools .

HELP
Type these commands for very brief help messages.

  mbsum --help
  bucky --help

EXAMPLE
Suppose that you have a directory where each file is of the form *.t and is a MrBayes output file.
Use mbsum to summarize each file.  Remove the first 1000 trees of each for burnin.

  for X in *.t; do mbsum -n 1000 $X; done

This will create a file named <filename>.in for each file named <filename>.t .
Warning!  It will overwrite files with the name <filename>.in if they exist.

Next, to run bucky with default parameters, try this.

  bucky *.in

This will create a bunch of output files of the form run1.* .
You can pick your own root file name.

YEAST EXAMPLE
To try the yeast example described in the Ane et-al MBE paper (with a much smaller number of updates),
you can try the following.

  cd $BUCKY_HOME/BUCKy-1.2/data/yeast
  ../../src/bucky y???/*.in

EXAMINING OUTPUT
Mac users who want to use standard Mac applications to read the output can open any of the output files
using TextEdit.
